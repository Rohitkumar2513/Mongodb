          While building a software application, the question arises where will
          you store your data and how? The traditional approach is a simple text
          file or CSV file which is not a good choice in todayâ€™s big data world.
          The solution is Database Management System(DBMS) which allows
          different user application programs to concurrently access the same
          Database.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Database Management system(DBMS) is a simpler, easier, reliable,
          faster, secure, and powerful software tool for Storing, Managing, and
          Retrieving data. There are two types of Databases: Relational and
          Non-Relational Databases. An example of a Relational Database is SQL
          Server and a Non-Relational Database is MongoDB. We will be discussing
          the key differences between MongoDB vs SQL Server in this blog.
        </p>
        <h2>What is MongoDB?</h2>
        <p>
          MongoDB is an open-source, cross-platform, document-oriented, and
          non-relational database system. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc.
          and was first released on February 11, 2009. Its stable release is
          MongoDB 5.0.5 released on 6 December 2021. It is written in different
          programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, C++, C,
          Ruby, Perl.
        </p>
        <img

          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          MongoDB is a NoSQL Server in which data is stored in BSON (Binary
          JSON) documents and each document is essentially built on a key-value
          pair structure. As MongoDB easily stores schemaless data, make it
          appropriate for capturing data whose structure is not known. This
          document-oriented approach is designed to offer a richer experience
          with modern programming techniques.

        <h2>Features of MongoDB</h2>
        <img
          class="img-3"
          src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hevo/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1644486462/hevo-learn/mongodb-architecure/mongodb-architecure.png?_i=AA"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>Main features of MongoDB which make it unique are:</p>
        <h3>High Performance</h3>
        <p>
          Data operations on MongoDB are fast and easy because of their NoSQL
          nature. Data can be quickly stored, manipulated, and retrieved without
          any compromise on data integrity.
        </p>
        <h3>Scalability</h3>
        <p>
          In the Big Data era, MongoDB data can be distributed across a cluster
          of machines quickly and equally, free of bulkiness. The scalability of
          MongoDB handles a growing amount of data capably. Sharding is a
          process in MongoDB used to horizontally scale the data across multiple
          servers when the size of data increases.
        </p>
        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>
          Data is highly available with MongoDB as it makes multiple copies of
          the same data and sends copies of data across different servers. In
          case any server fails, data can be retrieved from another server
          without delay.
        </p>
        <h3>Flexibility</h3>
        <p>
          MongoDB can easily be combined with different Database Management
          Systems, both SQL and NoSQL types. Document-oriented structure makes
          MongoDB schema dynamically flexible and different types of data can be
          easily stored and manipulated.
        </p>
        <h2>What is SQL Server?</h2>
        <img
          class="img-4"
          src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hevo/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1644478410/hevo-learn/sql-server_logo/sql-server_logo.jpg?_i=AA"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          SQL Server is a Relational Database Management System(RDBMS). It is
          also known as Microsoft SQL Server or sometimes as MSSQL. SQL Server
          is developed by Microsoft and was initially releases on April 24,
          1989. Its stable release is SQL Server 2019 released on 4 November
          2019. MSSQL is written in programming languages like C and C++.
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL Server is based on the relational model introduced by E. F. Codd.
          In RDBMS data is stored in tables and the relationships among the data
          are maintained between tables. In tables, data is organized in rows
          and columns format. Each column represents a particular field or
          feature and each row in the table represents an entry or a record.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft SQL Server offers a variety of editions with different
          functionally: Express, Enterprise, Standard, Web, Developer. Express
          edition is freeware for small and entry-level applications while
          others are licensed-based editions used for bigger projects on
          commercial levels based on the service required. SQL Server supports
          XML data type format and dynamic management views.

        <h3>Features of SQL Server</h3>
        <img
          class="img-5"
          src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hevo/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1644486589/hevo-learn/SQL-Server-architecture/SQL-Server-architecture.png?_i=AA"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>Main features of SQL Server that make it highly usable are:</p>
        <h3>Cloud Database Support</h3>
        <p>
          Microsoft SQL Server offers editions that can be integrated with
          Microsoft cloud or Azure SQL with built-in security and manageability.
          Cloud database support makes SQL Server highly available, fast
          failover with minimum uptime.
        </p>
        <h3>Ease of Management</h3>
        <p>
          Microsoft SQL Servers can easily be used with Windows and Linux
          systems. SQL Server deployment and its management is easy with
          Kubernetes.
        </p>
        <h3>High Security</h3>
        <p>
          Data in SQL Server is encrypted and highly secured. Schemas and Tables
          can be password protected easily and can be accessed with permissions
          only.
        </p>
        <h3>End-to-End Business Data Solutions</h3>
        <p>
          SQL Server mainly focuses on commercial needs so it provides
          end-to-end business data solutions. Microsoft SQL Server offers tools
          for Data Administration, ETL solutions, Online Analytical
          Processing(OLAP), and Data Mining purposes. It additionally provides
          Option Reporting, Interactive Analysis, and Visual Data Exploration
          using SQL Server BI tools.

        </figure>
        <p>
          The following section talks about the primary differences between
          MongoDB vs SQL Server in detail:
        </p>
        <h3>Developed by and Initial Release</h3>
        <p>
          MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and was initially released on
          February 11, 2009.
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL Server is developed by Microsoft Corporation and was initially
          released on April 24, 1989.
        </p>
        <h3>Database Model</h3>
        <p>
          MongoDB is a Non-Relational Database based on a document-oriented
          structure that internally is based on a key-value structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL Server is a Relational Database based on relatable structured
          tables with various rows and columns.
        </p>
        <h3>Implementation Language</h3>
        <p>
          MongoDB is implemented in JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, C++, C, Ruby,
          Perl, C, C++ whereas SQL Server is implemented in C and C++.
        </p>
        <h3>License</h3>
        <p>
          MongoDB is an Open-Source DBMS whereas a SQL Server license is
          required for commercial purposes.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Schema</h3>
        <p>
          MongoDB has a flexible dynamic schema that can easily be changed with
          the evolution of data, application, or business.
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL Server has a fixed Schema that is predefined before inserting any
          data. Fixed schema means schema canâ€™t be changed as data, application,
          or business requirement evolves.
        </p>
        <h3>Query Language</h3>
        <p>
          MongoDB uses MongoDB Query Language to query unstructured data from
          the database.
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL Server uses SQL Query Language to Create Tables, Insert, Fetch or
          Update data in the database.
        </p>
        <h3>Scalability</h3>
        <p>
          MongoDB supports Horizontal Scaling in which data is distributed
          across clusters. The Sharding process is used to implement horizontal
          scaling which results in an always-up server.
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL Server supports vertical scaling which is the traditional
          approach. In vertical scaling, physical or virtual resources are added
          to the hosting server of the database.
        </p>
        <h3>Map Reduce</h3>
        <p>
          MongoDB supports a data processing algorithm for concentrating large
          volumes of data into aggregated results. MongoDB provides the
          MapReduce database command to perform map-reduce operations.
        </p>
        <p>SQL Server does not support the Map-Reduce method.</p>
        <h3>Joins</h3>
        <p>
          MongoDB is a non-relational database so it does not support JOINs
          whereas SQL Server used JOINS to retrieve data from multiple tables
          which are joined.
        </p>
        <h3>Transaction</h3>
        <p>
          MongoDB provides multi-document ACID transactions (ACID is an acronym
          for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) with snapshot
          isolation, which ensures that the database is in a valid state after a
          set of database operations is executed.
        </p>
        <p>
          MS SQL Server also provides ACID transactions with data integrity
          without snapshot isolation.
        </p>
        <h3>XML support</h3>
        <p>
          MongoDB doesnâ€™t support XML structured documents. Documents in MongoDB
          are stored in BSON format.
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL Server provides support for XML structured data. XML support is
          integrated into all the components of SQL Server.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          MongoDB is a database that is more advanced and capable of handling
          big data with dynamic schema features. SQL Server is an RDBMS that is
          used to manage the relational database system and offers end-to-end
          business data solutions. In the case of unstructured data MongoDB is a
          good choice. Also, MongoDB is open source which makes it readily
          available.
        </p>
        <p>
          No doubt SQL Server is going strong for many years but now with the
          era of Big Data, MongoDB seems to have a bright future. But, that
          doesnâ€™t mean SQL Server will be completely eradicated. The choice of
          database between MongoDB and SQL Server is completely specific to the
          userâ€™s needs.
